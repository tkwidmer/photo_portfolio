I’ve been thinking a lot about Virginia Woolf’s groundbreaking essay _A Room of One’s Own_ and how her thesis still holds true almost eighty years later.

Woolf notes in her essay that it’s really difficult to achieve success when you have not been given the opportunity to do so. Over the course of her writing she outlines the multiplicity of factors that lead to having the opportunity to be successful. She points out that part of the reason that men historically achieved great success and written prolifically was that they were given the opportunity (read: funding, housing) while the majority of women have not. Her thesis is that “a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.”

I’d like to rephrase Woolf’s thesis for the 21st century and my situation: “A woman must have financial support and a cubicle of their own if they are to learn how to code.”

This is a reality I have learned all too well over the past nine months. I'm not independently wealthy and I don’t have a partner financially supporting me. If I wanted to learn how to code, I would have to do so while continuing to work a full time job to pay my rent. The reality is I've got rent (and other numerous bills) due every month. It very quickly becomes evident why Woolf argued that women need to be provided with the financial support. Without it, here is what inevitably happens:

A vicious cycle manifests in which, because I've got to pay rent - I've got to work a job. But because i've got to work a job I've got a lot less time to spend studying programming. This leads to the student spending any free time they are not at work on code. In addition because the job I work has me working in the evenings - I can't attend as many of the wonderful meetups and workshops offered in the bay area to those learning how to code. This makes me want to work harder in my off time.

Since starting to learn how to code I've spent almost every break, lunch break, and morning before my job on my computer coding or reading about code. This has been an amazing, quick, and fulfilling seven months - but it has also been exhausting. Instead of spending my off time resting, I've been continuing to work. I'm exhausted both mentally and physically. This means the worker (in this case, me) is at an increased risk for burn out or mental exhaustion.

Sometimes it feels like i'm just treading water and not really advancing. Virginia Woolf could not have been more right. Unless you are provided the support - it’s like you are playing against a stacked deck.

Let’s face it: the economy sucks. We are living in an era with the highest wage gap in America that we have ever seen. A large wage gap it makes it really difficult for there to be any class mobility. Because of this, the economically disadvantaged find it harder and harder to “pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.” (For more on this: you should really check out the amazing documentary ["Inequality for All."](http://inequalityforall.com/)) The economically disadvantaged end up working harder and harder for less and less spending power. Many folks find themselves working two, three, or even four jobs just to keep up with their living expenses (especially those with families.

I’m in the process of trying to “pull myself up by my own bootstraps” by teaching myself how to code. But to be honest, it’s a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. Not the code portion - that I’m actually picking up rather quickly - but the logistics of trying to create the opportunity to spend the time I want learning how to code.

I've started a [GitTip account](http://www.gittip.com/tkwidmer) for people who wish to support not only my work on [Refuge Restrooms](http://www.teaganwidmer.me/programming/refugerestrooms) but also to support my development as a software engineer. [If you can make even a small weekly contribution it would help](http://www.gittip.com/tkwidmer). My goal is to make at least 200$ a week on Gittip. If I can make more than 200$ a week I can drop to part time at my hourly day job. [If I can earn 500$](http://www.gittip.com/tkwidmer) a week on Gittip I can quit my job entirely and work on software development full time.

I am a feminist. I believe in looking an analyzing the systems of power that lead to the circumstances in which we are living. The tech has a pretty serious culture problem and is [only now starting to recognize](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/) just how much this issue may be tied to the gender gap in tech. Technology is a male dominated field. And its for the same reason that every other field is male dominated. Women are not often given the resources to train themselves to succeed. As I start up this professional programming focused blog as a woman trying to get into the tech industry - I felt it was important to recognize this. This is why I've decided to name this blog "A Cubicle Of My Own." On this blog Ill be talking about programming, about my journey as a self taught web developer, but also issues related to women in tech and diversity in tech. I hope you enjoy it.
