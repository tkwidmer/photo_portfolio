    <h3> Bio </h3>
    <p> I've been making photographs for about twelve years. I fell in love with photography
    at a young age by experimenting with my father's metal Nikon SLR. Later I furthered
    my skills by studying photography in college.

    Today I shoot a Canon 7D and a Fujifilm X100-T and edit in Photoshop or in CameraBag Photo.
